#### Necessary Deliverables


**Week 5:**

By the end of week 5:

- A **completed, basic version of the user interface for your app**, with placeholder data and resources to fill out your screens

**Week 6:**

By the end of week 6:

- Working cloud synchronization using API integration
- A final, working version of your app
- A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
- **A ``readme.md`` file** describing what the app does, and any bugs that may exist
- One screenshot in the ``readme.md``
- Automated tests for your code

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Complete as much of the layout as possible before working on your logic.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic helps.
- Test functionality as soon as you complete it.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your project will be [evaluated using the attached rubric](./rubric.md), which assesses your technical requirements based on the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _(If applicable) Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
